📚 React Fundamentals & Core Concepts

During Week 1 of my internship, I focused on building a strong foundation in React.js and understanding how modern frontend applications work.

🧠 What I Learned
	•	⚛️ What React is and how it works
	•	🧩 Components (Functional Components)
	•	📦 JSX (JavaScript + HTML syntax)
	•	🔁 Props and Component Reusability
	•	🧠 State Management using useState
	•	⚡ Side Effects using useEffect
	•	🔄 Rendering & Re-rendering
	•	📌 Event Handling in React
	•	📦 Updating Objects & Arrays in State
	•	🧠 Understanding Immutability
	•	🎯 Conditional Rendering
	•	🔄 React Rendering Lifecycle (Render & Commit)

⸻

🛠 Mini Projects Built
	•	⏱ Stopwatch App (with dark/light mode, laps, localStorage)
	•	🎬 Movie Search App (API integration – OMDB)
	•	✅ Smart To-Do App (CRUD operations, toggle, delete)

⸻

💡 Key Takeaways
	•	State works like a snapshot.
	•	React re-renders when state changes.
	•	Never mutate state directly.
	•	Use updater functions for multiple state updates.
	•	Keep components clean and reusable.

⸻

🎯 Outcome

By the end of Week 1, I’m confident in:
	•	Building interactive UI using React
	•	Managing component state effectively
	•	Handling API calls
	•	Structuring small-to-medium React projects
